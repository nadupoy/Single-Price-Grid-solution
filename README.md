## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- VS Code

### What I learned

This challenge introduced me to HTML entities that enabled me to add spacing between inline elements as shown below:

```html
<p id="line_01">
    <span>$29</span>&nbsp per month
</p>
```


### Continued development

I would like to learn how to position an element in relation to its ancestor i.e. position a <footer> in relation to the <html>.

So far I was unable to achieve this using the various CSS selectors available but I hope to do so as I learn more.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) - This helped me understand HTML tags and CSS properties. I really liked this website and will use it going forward
